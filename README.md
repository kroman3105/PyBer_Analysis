# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
We were directed by PyBer's CEO to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.  Once created, we will then use the tools at our disposal (ie. Pandas, Matplotlib) to create a multiple-line graph showing total weekly fares for each city type.  Our objective is to use this data to show the differences that exist between city types, in order to help PyBer leadership make informed decisions when dealing with all types of cities.

## Results
The results of our summarized DataFrame can be found below: 

![DataFrame_By_Type](https://github.com/kroman3105/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/DataFrame_By_Type.PNG).  

The DataFrame revealed the following results:

# Rural Cities
 - Rural cities had the fewest number of rides at 125 over the period analyzed
 - Rural cities also had the fewest number of drivers at 78 over the period analyzed
 - Rural cities brought in $4,327.93 of total fares
 - Rural cities had the highest average fare per ride and per driver at $34.62 and $55.49 respectively
